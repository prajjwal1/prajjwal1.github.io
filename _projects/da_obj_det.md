Project URL: https://github.com/prajjwal1/autonomous-object-detection

- Created a novel architecture with domain adaption components meant to work on
minimizing h divergence trained in an adversarial manner.
- Implemented various efficient transfer learning approaches to prevent over-
catastrophic forgetting and facilitate incremental learning.
- Worked with RPN, SSD, Yolo based models on IDD,KITTI,BDD,cityscapes for real
time navigation systems
