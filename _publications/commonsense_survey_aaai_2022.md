### Abstract
While commonsense knowledge acquisition and reasoning has traditionally been a core research topic in
the knowledge representation and reasoning community, recent years have seen a surge of interest in the
natural language processing community in developing pre-trained models and testing their ability to
address a variety of newly designed commonsense knowledge reasoning and generation tasks. This paper
presents a survey of these tasks, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art
pre-trained models for commonsense reasoning and generation as revealed by these tasks, and reflects
on future research directions.
