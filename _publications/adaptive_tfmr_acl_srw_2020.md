### Abstract
Coming soon

This is a placeholder for the paper. Paper will be uploaded to arXiv after the camera ready deadline which is 15 May 2020. Stay tuned. 

The Code can be found on [Adaptive Transformers](https://github.com/prajjwal1/adaptive_transformers). I've also released a standalone project which can be found here [Fluence](https://github.com/prajjwal1/fluence).
