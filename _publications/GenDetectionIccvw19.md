Abstract:

Object detection has seen tremendous progress in recent years. However, current algorithms donâ€™t generalize well when tested on diverse data distributions. We address the problem of incremental learning in object detection on the India Driving Dataset (IDD). Our approach involves us- ing multiple domain-specific classifiers and effective transfer learning techniques focussed on avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on the IDD and BDD100K dataset. Results show the effectiveness of our domain adaptive approach in the case of domain shifts in environments.
