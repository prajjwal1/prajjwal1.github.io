There is a lot that can go here. I'll keep dumping more as stumble across more pointers and interesting ideas.

Conscientious.

Aesthete: I have been enjoying museum trips quite a lot. It all started at the Stanford Cantor Arts Center where I got involved in a stimulating conversation by chance about one of the paintings (Van Gogh included) and a sculpture by Auguste Rodin. My favourite ones have been Legion of Honor in SF, MET in NYC. Have to do tons of exploration in NYC.

There are two causes I spend a lot of time thinking about. I think if we can make meaningful progress in both, we would have far reaching impacts on Humanity. 1) AI 2) Longevity Science. I work in AI, i have had very engaging and thought provoking conversations about its future and its implications. I am grateful to be working in the space thats looked upon by multitudes now. Regarding aging science, I am continuously on the lookout for facts/data that I can use to alter my lifestyle and also share that information. I have read Lifespan by David Sinclair, listened to his podcast and every interview. I like to see Bryan Johnson. I've adopted his style of diet and appreciate the conviction. I workout most days of the week. I have consumed plethora of resources on nutrition too. One book is How Not to Die by Michael Gregory. I actively listen to Andrew Huberman, Rhonda Patrick, Peter Attia. The science concerning these areas can be hard to make complete sense of, so I do my due dilligence to listen to many experts.

I'm a guilty of being a movie buff. Its what I did during my undergrad. Take ML courses, do projects that involved its application, and watch mpvies. I've lived many movies and look forward to ones from favourite filmmakers. Chris Nolan is legendary in what he is able to accomplish. Binding these abstract science fiction ideas with humane elements with sheer emphasis on how its delivered is only something he is able to pull off remarkably well. That combined with Hans Zimmer is pure magic. I also anticipate movies from Denis Villenuve these days. I always have a lot to talk about this topic and a big list of recommendations, which ends up overwhelming people. 

I got into philosophy, especially Stoicism during senior year of undergrad. I think Ryan Holiday popped up into my feed one day. I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Letters to a Stoic by Seneca, Discourses by Epictetus, Man's search for meaning by Victor Frankle, Stoicism and the art of Happiness, The courage to be disliked. At that time i was introspecting a lot about the nature of the world we live in, what is the purpose of our existence, where we are going, how to think rationally, and the maeaning of our existence. I have found some clarity towards some of these questions and continue to look for more. I think Sam Harris has had a massive impact on my viewpoints this year (2023). I've listened to him quite extensively and have enjoyed all of the debates he has had. Meditation, what is it, I have no qualms about it after listening to his sessions on [Waking up](https://wakingup.com) rigorously. Meditation made parts of philiosophy accessible to me. His thoughts on mortality, free will, meditation, religion (along with Richard Dawkins) have opened up my horizon on the nature of reality we live in.

I have explored minimalism. It makes a lot of sense for individuals to adopt it. Breaking the cycle of what marketing is doing and taking the time to realize what's required by you. I have read Longing for Less (Minimalism)
