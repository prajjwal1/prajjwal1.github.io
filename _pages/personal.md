# Influences
My thinking has been greatly been influenced by Sam Harris. I've listened to Making Sense extensively and spent 150+ hours on Waking up (cannot recommened it enough). Not only have i gotten more eclectic and curious due to the diverse range of conversations he has had, realizing how fundamental they are (free will, witnessing the nature of your mind etc.) has made me a lot more contemplative about our state of the world and our presence in it. 

My favourite book to this day is The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. He provides a very fundamental theory based on Dawinian principles, natural selection to answer some of the most profound questions, where do we come from, how complexity arose from simplicity, why are we the way we are, how our behaviours (love, altruism, etc.) emerged and so much more. It presents a view of where life has been heading and where it would continue to head. I had a chance to see him on his tour of "The Genetic Book of the dead".

I wrote a [blog recently on why age reversal](https://medium.com/@prajfb/why-age-reversal-should-be-your-fitness-goal-f5384b1f47c8) is an all encompassing goal we should be thinking of having.
