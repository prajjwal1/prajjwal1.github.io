I sometimes go to libraries on weekends.

[Movies] I'm a big movie buff. Movies are not just mere form of entertainment for me. I have a huge list of movies to recommend at a given time. Same with TV shows. I am a big fan of Chris Nolan and Hans Zimmer. 
[Philosophy]: Into both eastern and western philisophy. Stocicism (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca). I avidly listen to Sam Harris (free will, morality, [meditation](https://wakingup.com), rationality).
[Health]: I have learned a lot about nutrition and diet, what it does to us, how can we use it to our own advantage. I have read, listened to Michael Gregory, Peter Attia, David Sinclair, Bryan Johnson, Andrew Huberman, Rhonda Patrick quite extensively.
