Using this corner of the internet to share personal things about myself. 

I am an AI Researcher/Engineer, really fond of thinking about pushing the capabilities of current AI approaches and the future they promise. It all started in the freshmen year of college, of me thinking about what is going to be the most radical discipline that has the potential to benefit humanity in 2017.

I have a deep admiration for movies.
