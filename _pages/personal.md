Here you will find my interests and learnings. I will continue to update this as I learn more.

[Books](/personal/books) I've read. This journey started around mid-2020 from audiobooks to now physical hard copies. I sometimes go to libraries on weekends.

[Movies](/personal/movies) I'm a big movie buff. Movies are not just mere form of entertainment for me. 

[Philosophy](/personal/philosophy) 

[Nutrition](/personal/nutrition) I consider this to be very essential to crack. Throughout the last 3 years, I've changed my diet a lot. 

[Aging](/personal/aging) I got into Aging science after listening to David Sinclair. A lot of people get into it after listening to him. My perception has been changed on how aging happens. I continue to alter my lifestyle based on the new scientific evidence we obtain.

[Finance](/personal/finance)
