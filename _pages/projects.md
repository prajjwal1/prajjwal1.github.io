All projects are open sourced and can be found at my [Github](https://github.com/prajjwal1). Most of them are codebases for paper which are listed [here](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/). Here are projects which are not associated directly with any of my papers.

### Fluence
Winner of Pytorch Global Hackathon 2020. A Pytorch based [library](https://github.com/prajjwal1/fluence) for language understanding with regards to increasing robustness (fairness) and improving compute efficiency.


### Open source contributions
I've made several contributions to [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aprajjwal1+is%3Aclosed) and [Huggingface Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aprajjwal1+is%3Aclosed)

### Autonomous Object Detection
This [project](https://github.com/prajjwal1/autonomous-object-detection) focussed on 2D object detection with Pytorch. User can leverage models provided from `torchvision` and use datasets provided in this project (`idd`, `cityscapes`, `bdd`) for training and evaluation of models. Additionally, support for incremental learning was added.
