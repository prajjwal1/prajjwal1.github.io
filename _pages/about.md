I am a senior year undergraduate computer science student deeply interested in AI research. I'm mostly self taught and conduct research without supervision. My research interests lie in the general area of deep learning (learning richer representations) including computer vision, NLP, graph ML. I've worked in many domains, some of them include multi modal systems, adaptive computation methods, language modelling, person reidentification, autonomous object detection for self driving. I also have experience in deploying optimized models for edge inference. I am interested in obtained research oriented roles/positions. All of my projects are mostly open-sourced. I am an avid Pytorch user and contribute to it from time to time. Previously I've published at ICCVW.   
I deeply care about promoting AI research. I run a [blog](https://prajjwal1.github.io/blog) and a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/aijournal) in free time.
