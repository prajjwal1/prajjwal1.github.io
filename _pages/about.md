I am a CS graduate student at University of Texas Dallas specializing in ML research. My research interests lie in the general area of deep learning, representation learning, including computer vision and language. 

I have previously worked on numerous domains in computer vision during my internships which includes [Person Re-Identification](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/IncrementalPersonReid), Depth Perception and 3D Object Detection. Out of my interests, I've worked extensively on classification based tasks and evaluating [generalization of detection models](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/GenDetectionIccvw19). I've also written numerous [blog posts](https://prajjwal1.github.io/blog/) about it.

To explore further interests, I've made a transition to NLP especially language understanding and how we can form generalized representations which can be harnessed for subsequent downstream tasks. I care about accessibility and impact marked by our research. Specifically I looked at [Adaptive methods](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/adaptive_tfmr_acl_srw_2020) and how can they be used to create efficient Multi-modal transformer based architectures. Recently I won [Pytorch Global Summer Hackathon](https://pytorch.org/blog/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2020-global-pytorch-summer-hackathon/) for my project [Fluence](https://github.com/prajjwal1/fluence). It focusses about reducing computation and inculcating robustness for transformers.

I deeply care about promoting clairty AI research. Started a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/aijournal) in free time for which I don't have sparse time nowadays.
