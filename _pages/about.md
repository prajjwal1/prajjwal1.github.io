I am a CS graduate student at University of Texas Dallas specializing in NLP research under [Prof. Vincent Ng](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/). My thesis is about commonsense reasoning through adversarial learning. My research interests lie in the general area of deep learning, representation learning, including computer vision and language. My current interests include language understanding tasks with respect to reasoning and interpretability.

I have previously worked on numerous domains in computer vision during my internships which includes [Person Re-Identification](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/IncrementalPersonReid), [Depth Perception and 3D Object Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlDTgj3Kut8). Out of my interests, I've worked extensively on visual recognition based tasks and [generalization of detection models](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/GenDetectionIccvw19). I've also written numerous [blog posts](https://prajjwal1.github.io/blog/) about it.

To explore further interests, I've made a transition to NLP especially language understanding and how we can form generalized representations which can be harnessed for subsequent downstream tasks. I care about accessibility and impact marked by our research. Specifically I looked at [Adaptive methods](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/adaptive_tfmr_acl_srw_2020) and how can they be used to create efficient Multi-modal transformer based architectures. Recently I won [Pytorch Global Summer Hackathon](https://pytorch.org/blog/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2020-global-pytorch-summer-hackathon/) for my project [Fluence](https://github.com/prajjwal1/fluence). It focusses about addressing the task of lanuguage understanding responsibly (fairness and computational efficiency).

I deeply care about promoting clairty AI research. I have a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/aijournal) which is not maintained.
