I am an AI Resident at [Meta AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com) (FAIR) in the [Conversational AI team](https://ai.facebook.com/research/conversational-ai/) working
under [Chinnadhurai Sankar](https://chinnadhurai.github.io).
Previously, I was a CS graduate student at the University of Texas Dallas where I worked on commonsense reasoning under
[Prof. Vincent Ng](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/). My thesis is about improving commonsense reasoning through adversarial
learning (coming soon). My research interests lie in the general area of deep learning and representation learning, especially at the intersection
of computer vision and language.

**Vision**
I have previously worked on numerous domains in computer vision during my internships which includes
[Person Re-Identification](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/IncrementalPersonReid),
[Depth Perception and 3D Object Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlDTgj3Kut8). Out of my interests,
I've worked extensively on visual recognition based tasks and
[generalization of detection models](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/GenDetectionIccvw19).
I've also written numerous [blog posts](https://prajjwal1.github.io/blog/) about it.

**Language**
To explore further interests, I've made a transition to NLP especially language understanding and how we can form
generalized representations which can be harnessed for subsequent downstream tasks. I care about the accessibility
and impact marked by my research. Specifically, I looked at
[Adaptive methods](https://prajjwal1.github.io/publications/adaptive_tfmr_acl_srw_2020) and how can they be used to
create efficient Multi-modal transformer-based architectures. Recently I won
[Pytorch Global Summer Hackathon](https://pytorch.org/blog/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2020-global-pytorch-summer-hackathon/)
for my project [Fluence](https://github.com/prajjwal1/fluence). It focuses on addressing the task of language
understanding responsibly (fairness and computational efficiency).

My recent projects have looked more closely at reasoning.
[Generalization in NLI ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01518) project looked at how out-of-domain generalization in
pre-trained Language Models can be improved from biased data (MNLI -> HANS). My graduate research looked specifically
at commonsense reasoning within pre-trained Langauge Models. The [AAAI survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12438) provides
a comprehensive look at the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art pre-trained models for commonsense reasoning and
generation.


I created a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/aijournal) to disseminate technical content from research papers.
After graduate school, my interest has changed about creating content as a result of which this project is
unmaintained right now.
